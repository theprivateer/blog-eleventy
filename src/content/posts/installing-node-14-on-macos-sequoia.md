I’m currently working on an older codebase that relies on Node 14 for a bunch of dependencies - the problem is you can no longer _easily_ install Node 14 (and earlier) on Apple computers with M-series chips, as they will always attempt to download the `arm64` version (which is only available for Node 16 onwards).

The solution is to install **NVM** (Node Version Manager) using a [Rosetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)#Rosetta_2) shell to download an `x86` version.

First up, uninstall **NVM** if it has already been installed using Homebrew:

```sh
brew uninstall nvm
brew cleanup
```

Next, install **Rosetta** if it isn’t already installed:

```sh
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

Now that Rosetta is installed we need to reopen the terminal in a Rosetta shell. If using the default macOS terminal, find it in the `/Applications/Utilities` directory in Finder, right-click the application and click ‘Get Info’. Find and check ‘Open using Rosetta’, and then restart the app.

Next switch out of the `arm64` architecture by running the following command in the reopened terminal window:

```sh
arch -x86_64 zsh
```

Make sure your account has `.zshrc` file in the root directory -  the **NVM** installation in the next step will attempt to append a few lines of configuration. If you do not have a `.zshrc` file just create and empty one:

```sh
cd ~
touch .zshrc
```

Install **NVM**:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
```

Restart the terminal and check if **NVM** is installed successfully by running:

```sh
nvm -v
```

Now we can install Node with **NVM** as usual:

```sh
nvm install 14
```

You are then free to uncheck ‘Open using Rosetta’ for your terminal app.
