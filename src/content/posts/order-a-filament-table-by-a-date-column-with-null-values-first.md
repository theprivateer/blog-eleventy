The custom CMS I am using for this blog uses Laravel and [Filament](https://filamentphp.com) under the hood. The data model is rudimentary - I currently have separate models for the blog posts and entries for the 365 Albums project, each of which have a `published_at` column. This is used to control visibility on the site - it allows me to schedule posts in the future, as well as create ‘draft’ posts with no `published_at` value (i.e. `NULL`).

On the Filament tables that power the UI in the backend, I want to list the posts (or albums) in reverse chronological order, with the newest (and future scheduled) posts first. I also want to show draft posts first.

In MySQL, when using _ascending_ order the `NULL` values come first - so by flipping this (i.e. using `DESC` order) the `NULL` values come last.

One way we can get around this my using a minus operator on the column name: 

```sql
ORDER BY -published_at ASC
```

This will reverse all of the date values (essentially ordering by `DESC`), without affecting the `NULL` values on the column. This will keep them _before_ the values with a date when sorting in ascending order.

On the Filament resource we can add a default sort order to the return value of the `table` static method: 

```php
->defaultSort(fn ($query) => $query->orderByRaw('-published_at asc'));
```

This is just one way to achieve this sorting behaviour. I may change this up in the future (when I have more database entries) to see if there is an optimal approach.

It’s worth noting that PostgreSQL treats `NULL` values as very large, so will automatically put the ‘draft’ posts before the dated posts when sorting in descending order.
